9:T1fa2,<h1>Emergent Design</h1>
<p>Making Better Decisions With Simplicity, Humility &#x26; Reality</p>
<h2>How Do We Make Decisions?</h2>
<p>Have you ever noticed how fast you form an opinion about something?
A design idea shows up in a meeting, and within seconds your brain goes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Yes, this makes sense.”</em></li>
<li><em>“No, this won’t work.”</em></li>
<li><em>“We should build it ourselves.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Let’s use some 3rd party integration.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these reactions feel logical.
But they’re not. They’re instincts shaped by our <strong>past experiences</strong>, and they’re full of <strong>biases</strong>.</p>
<p>We trust our first impressions far more than we should — and it affects decision making and architecture eventually.</p>
<p>Before diving into systems, design, and trade-offs, let’s acknowledge the truth:</p>
<p><strong>We don’t make decisions rationally. We make them emotionally first, then justify them logically.</strong></p>
<p>And that’s exactly where things go wrong.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>A Quick Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve spent years building systems, scaling teams, and making architectural decisions under pressure.
Through that journey I realized something counter-intuitive:</p>
<p><strong>The best architecture is not the one we design upfront —
it’s the one that emerges from reality.</strong></p>
<p>This discovery led me deep into Emergent Design.</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>The Problem: We Are Biased Creatures</strong></h1>
<p>To warm up the room, I often show a list of cognitive biases and ask the audience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Who knows this one?”</em>
<em>“Who has fallen for that one?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always fun — and uncomfortable — because everyone recognizes themselves.</p>
<p>Here are some classics we hit daily as engineers:</p>
<h3><strong>Confirmation Bias</strong></h3>
<p>We notice evidence that supports what we already believe.
<em>Example:</em> You prefer building auth in-house, so you read only articles that say “auth isn't that hard” and ignore warnings about security or enterprise SSO needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Anchoring Bias</strong></h3>
<p>We cling to the first estimate or idea we heard.
<em>Example:</em> Someone says “two weeks,” and suddenly every discussion gravitates around that number — even when reality says otherwise.</p>
<h3><strong>Availability Bias</strong></h3>
<p>We judge decisions based on the examples that come to mind easily, not on actual data.
<em>Example:</em> You once had a bad experience with a 3rd-party provider, so you think it’s risky — even if the real risk today is low.</p>
<h3><strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy</strong></h3>
<p>We stick with failing decisions because we’ve already invested time and resources.
<em>Example:</em> You keep pushing a custom solution even though switching to Okta is now smarter — simply because you’ve already spent a month on it.</p>
<h3><strong>Optimism Bias</strong></h3>
<p>We underestimate risks because we believe things will “just work.”
<em>Example:</em> You assume your custom identity solution will scale without issues — despite having zero data to support that confidence.</p>
<p>These biases shape our decisions more than any design pattern or architectural principle ever will.</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>A Real Story: Adding User Identity to a System</strong></h1>
<p>Let’s take a real case:
<strong>Adding user identity to a growing product.</strong></p>
<p>Two separate contexts, two very different decisions.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Case A: B2C — Simple, Fast, Self-Implemented Authentication</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Need a branded, tailored user experience</li>
<li>Minimal business complexity</li>
<li>Fast development cycles</li>
<li>Few enterprise expectations</li>
<li>Small team, tight deadlines</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, building auth internally is simple, cheap, and effective.
A lightweight implementation works beautifully for a long time.</p>
<p><em>Reality beats prediction.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Case B: B2B — Okta + SAML Integration</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise customers expect SSO</li>
<li>Compliance, audits, security reviews</li>
<li>SLA guarantees</li>
<li>Contractual obligations</li>
<li>Multi-tenant complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, building auth internally is a liability.
Okta/SAML integration is the correct path.</p>
<p><em>Context beats preference.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>What Is Emergent Design?</strong></h1>
<p>Emergent Design is the discipline of <strong>letting architecture evolve based on present reality</strong>, instead of predicting the future.</p>
<p>It’s not being “lazy” or “not planning.”
It’s being honest about uncertainty.</p>
<p>Here’s what it really means:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Simplicity First</strong></h3>
<p>Build the simplest version that works <strong>today</strong>, not the one you imagine you’ll need in 12 months.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Reality-Driven Decisions</strong></h3>
<p>Make decisions based on visible facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>customer needs</li>
<li>performance metrics</li>
<li>constraints</li>
<li>team capacity</li>
<li>operational incidents</li>
</ul>
<p>Not based on “what if one day…”</p>
<h3><strong>3. Reversible Decisions</strong></h3>
<p>Prefer choices you can undo cheaply.
Interfaces, adapters, flags, modular boundaries — all give you the freedom to evolve.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Bias Awareness</strong></h3>
<p>Because we know our brain is unreliable, we make decisions <strong>consciously</strong>, not automatically.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Continuous Evolution</strong></h3>
<p>Architecture grows like a living organism —
branching, pruning, shaping itself over time.</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>Why Emergent Design Wins</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>No Premature Commitments</strong></h3>
<p>Most expensive architecture decisions are based on fictional futures.</p>
<h3><strong>Lower Cost of Change</strong></h3>
<p>Small reversible steps → fewer painful rewrites.</p>
<h3><strong>Velocity Stays High</strong></h3>
<p>Simplicity makes teams faster.</p>
<h3><strong>Better Alignment with Reality</strong></h3>
<p>The system reflects <em>actual needs</em>, not guesses.</p>
<h3><strong>More Humility, Less Ego</strong></h3>
<p>Design becomes a team sport, not a fight for whose idea wins.</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>Supporting Values</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Simplicity</strong></h3>
<p>Start with what works now.
Get data before you predict.</p>
<h3><strong>Humility</strong></h3>
<p>Be okay saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I don’t know yet.”</li>
<li>“Let’s try and then decide.”</li>
<li>“Your point of view might be better.”</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Professional Curiosity</strong></h3>
<p>Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Is there a simpler way?”</li>
<li>“Is this reversible?”</li>
<li>“What signals are we seeing right now?”</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1><strong>Actionable Takeaways</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>1. Keep biases visible</strong></h3>
<p>Call out assumptions, expose them, and verify them with facts.
This makes the evolution of design visible and grounded.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Question “known solutions”</strong></h3>
<p>Just because a pattern exists
doesn’t mean it fits your context.</p>
<p><strong>Ask for other perspectives.
Challenge defaults.
Re-evaluate old decisions.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>Final Recommendations</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Use known patterns when they fit the <strong>present problem</strong>, not future hypotheticals.</li>
<li>Don’t stick to old decisions just because you made them.</li>
<li>Keep communication open — the fastest way to catch biases is through feedback.</li>
<li>Design in small reversible steps, and let the architecture emerge.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1><strong>Closing Thought</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Emergent Design is not about doing less —
it’s about doing the right things at the right time.</strong></p>
<p>The best architecture is the one that grows with the truth,
not the one built on our biases.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.
