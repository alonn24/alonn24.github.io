  "bio": "Meet Alon Yehezkel—part-time software wizard, full-time dad extraordinaire, and basketball fanatic. At 36, he's not just crunching code; he's crafting software magic with a side of dad jokes. When he's not debugging, you'll find him coaching his two mini-munchkins on the finer points of life or hitting the court for some hoop action. Alon's approach to fatherhood is like his coding style—simple, yet effective, with a dash of fun thrown in. With his trusty planner in hand, he effortlessly juggles bits and bytes with bedtime stories, proving that work-life balance is not just a myth—it's a slam dunk. Whether he's coding or shooting hoops, Alon's motto remains the same: keep it simple, stay playful, and never stop growing.",
